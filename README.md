# Sparsely
Lightweight sparse matrix c-library with python wrapper.

Focused on correctness, but should be fairly fast for many problems.

## Alternatives
* [pysparse](https://github.com/PythonOptimizers/pysparse) - Created in the early 2000s and the last update was back in 2015. Not possible to install on modern python anymore
* [scipy.sparse](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html) - Rather large library with everything from Fourier transforms, image processing to sparse matrices.
